# Spades

A team-based trick taking card game for 4 players.  [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spades_(card_game)).

The rules can vary wildly, so they are implemented as I learned them.

The game does support bots, but they are incredibly dumb at the moment.

## Built with

  * [gleam](https://gleam.run/)
  * React
  * [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
  * Postgres

## Running the application locally

To run the application using `docker-compose`, run:

  * `docker compose build`
  * `docker compose up`
  * Navigate to `localhost:5000` in your browser

Any file changes for the UI will recompile automatically and refresh the
application.

## "To break you, of course."
